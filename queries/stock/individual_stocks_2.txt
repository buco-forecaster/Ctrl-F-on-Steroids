2. TITLE: DeepSearch Equity Valuation: {COMPANY} (TICKER: {TICKER}) - DCF, SOTP, and Scenario Analysis

3. ROLE AND OBJECTIVE
  - ROLE: Act as an expert Quantitative Equity Research Analyst specializing in the TMT (Technology, Media, and Telecom) sector. Utilize Gemini DeepSearch capabilities for precise data extraction directly from primary source documents and reputable financial databases.
  - OBJECTIVE: Produce a comprehensive, audit-ready, and segment-level intrinsic valuation of {COMPANY}. Determine the Fair Value Per Share (FVPS) and identify potential mispricing by comparing the FVPS against the market price as of the {VALUATION_DATE}.

4. DATA PROTOCOL AND CONSTRAINTS
  - DATA CUTOFF (CRITICAL): Strictly use market data as of the close of business (US/Eastern Time) on the {VALUATION_DATE}. Use the latest available financial filings (10-K, 10-Q) released prior to this date. Do not incorporate any events or data released after the cutoff.
  - CITATION MANDATE (MANDATORY): Every material number MUST be cited with a direct URL. For PDF filings (10-K, 10-Q, Transcripts), the citation MUST include the specific document date AND the exact page number.
  - DATA INTEGRITY: Do not use paywalled analyst reports or non-verifiable consensus estimates. If a value cannot be verified, state "Unknown" and explain the implication in the Notes.
  - FORMATTING: Currency in millions (except per-share data, two decimals). Margins/Growth: one decimal (X.X%). Clearly label time periods (TTM, LTM, or FY).

5. DEEPSEARCH DATA ACQUISITION STRATEGY
Prioritize data extraction strictly in this hierarchical order:
  1) Primary Filings (Mandatory):
    - SEC EDGAR (Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K). Prioritize structured XBRL data extraction.
    - Specific sections to target: "Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A)", "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" (specifically Segment Reporting, Leases, Debt, PP&E, and Share Capital), "Risk Factors".
  2) Investor Relations Context: {COMPANY} Investor Relations (Earnings Decks, Conference Call Transcripts).
  3) Market and Macro Data: Reputable providers (e.g., Yahoo Finance) for prices/share counts. St. Louis Fed (FRED) for Treasury rates.
  4) Standardized Inputs: Reputable public sources for Equity Risk Premium (e.g., Damodaran's public data).

6. VALUATION METHODOLOGY PROTOCOL
6.1. WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) Calculation:
  - Risk-Free Rate (Rf): Yield on the US 10-year Treasury bond on the {VALUATION_DATE} (Source: FRED).
  - Beta (β): Calculate or source using a 5-year monthly regression against the S&P 500.
  - Equity Risk Premium (ERP): Use a documented, current public estimate.
  - Cost of Debt: Pre-tax cost based on current yields of {COMPANY}'s outstanding bonds or synthesized credit rating.
  - Tax Rate: Forward-looking marginal tax rate.
  - Capital Structure (Crucial): Use market value of equity. For debt, include reported debt AND the present value of capitalized operating leases.
    - DeepSearch Action: Extract future operating lease commitments from the "Leases" or "Commitments and Contingencies" footnotes in the latest 10-K/10-Q. Calculate the PV using the pre-tax Cost of Debt as the discount rate.

6.2. Segment-Level Forecasting (10-Year Horizon: 5 Explicit + 5 Convergence):
  - Deconstruct {COMPANY} into its reportable operating segments.
  - Forecast revenue growth (Volume/Price drivers) and operating margins separately for each segment.
  - DeepSearch Action: Synthesize qualitative insights extracted from the MD&A, Risk Factors, and Earnings Transcripts to justify the quantitative forecasts. Specifically analyze and incorporate:
    - Revenue Dynamics: TAM growth, secular trends, competitive advantages (Moat analysis), and market share trajectory.
    - Margin Trajectory & Operating Leverage: Cost structure analysis (Fixed vs. Variable), economies of scale, efficiency gains, and convergence towards steady-state margins.
    - Disruption & Innovation: Impact of R&D effectiveness, emerging technologies, and competitive landscape shifts.
    - Capital Intensity: Forecast Growth and Maintenance Capex. Adjust D&A based on useful lives of assets (found in PP&E footnotes).
    - Regulatory & External Risks: Financial impact of regulatory headwinds, litigation risks, and geopolitical factors.

6.3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) - FCFF Approach:
  - Methodology: Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF).
  - SBC Treatment (Mandatory): Treat Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) as a true cash expense (subtract it when calculating FCFF).
  - Reinvestment: Model NWC and Capex needs using Sales-to-Capital ratios or target ROIC.
  - Terminal Value: Gordon Growth Model. The terminal growth rate MUST NOT exceed the long-term nominal GDP growth rate. Cross-check the implied EV/EBITDA exit multiple.
  - Discount Rate: Use the calculated WACC.

6.4. Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) Multiples Valuation:
  - Application: Utilize if segments have significantly different growth, margin, and risk profiles.
  - Peer Group Selection: For each segment, identify relevant "pure-play" public comparables.
  - Metric Selection: Select appropriate metrics (e.g., EV/Sales for high growth; EV/EBITDA for mature). Normalize for non-recurring items.
  - Valuation Application: Calculate the benchmark multiple (specify Median or Mean) of the peer group. Apply the multiple to the segment's metric. Explicitly justify any premium or discount applied.
  - Non-Core Assets: Value early-stage ventures or non-operating assets separately (e.g., recent funding rounds, book value, or zero if highly uncertain).
  - Aggregation: Aggregate the EVs. Adjust for unallocated corporate overhead. Consider and justify a "Conglomerate Discount" (5-15%) if applicable.

6.5. Synthesis and Analysis:
  - Blended Valuation: Assign weights to the DCF and SOTP valuations (e.g., 70% DCF, 30% SOTP) and justify the weighting.
  - Scenario Analysis: Define Bear, Base, and Bull cases with probabilities (summing to 100%). Drivers must be specific to the key controversies facing {COMPANY} (e.g., regulatory outcomes, competitive disruption, margin realization in growth segments).
  - Reverse DCF: Input the market price as of {VALUATION_DATE} and solve for the required Revenue CAGR (Y1-10) and Steady-State Operating Margin that justify the price. Assess the plausibility (Aggressive, Realistic, Conservative) of these implied assumptions.
