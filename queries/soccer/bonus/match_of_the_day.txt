    Prompt: Your response must be only a single fenced code block containing a JSON object.
    Strict Output Requirements:
      1) Do not include any text, explanations, or comments before or after the JSON code block.
      2) The root must be a single JSON object.
      3) The top-level keys for this object must be strings representing a soccer match, using standard 3-letter team codes in the format HOME_vs_AWAY (e.g., AVL_vs_MCI).

@CONTENT
ROLE: Act as an expert quantitative sports analyst specializing in football probability modeling. Your task is to determine the fair probability of the specified {MARKET} using a multi-source,
      statistically calibrated approach, and assess if the {GIVEN_ODD} represents a Value Bet.
OBJECTIVE: Execute a 5-Phase analysis combining proprietary statistical modeling and synthesized external predictions to calculate the Expected Value (EV) of the provided bet.

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Prioritize data sources exactly as listed.
2. Do not fabricate data. If critical data (e.g., xG) is unavailable, state this limitation in the notes and rely on goal averages and Elo ratings as a fallback.
3. The final output must strictly adhere to the specified Markdown format.

PHASE 1: DATA ACQUISITION STRATEGY
Search and extract the following data points.

1.  **Advanced Metrics (Primary: Fbref; Secondary: WhoScored/Understat):**
    *   Season-to-date xG For/Against (must include Home/Away splits).
    *   Last 6 Matches xG For/Against.
2.  **Recent Form & Trends (Primary: SoccerSTATS):**
    *   Last 6 matches results (Home/Away specific).
    *   BTTS percentages (Season and Last 6 matches).
3.  **Team Strength Baseline (Primary: Clubelo):**
    *   Current Elo ratings for {HOME} and {AWAY}.
4.  **League Averages (Primary: Fbref or SoccerSTATS):**
    *   Average home goals (Avg_H) and average away goals (Avg_A) for the current {LEAGUE} season.
5.  **Contextual Factors (Primary: Flashscore, Reputable Sports News):**
    *   Verified/Predicted Lineups (within 48 hours of {DATA_CUTOFF}).
    *   Key injuries/suspensions (Assess impact on attacking/defensive capabilities).
6.  **External Prediction Models:**
    *   Sources: Forebet, SoccerStats (predictions), Betensured, EaglePredict, FootballWhispers.

PHASE 2: INTERNAL STATISTICAL MODELING
Calculate the proprietary probability based on acquired data.

1.  **Calculate Attack/Defense Strengths (AS/DS):**
    *   Determine AS and DS for both teams, prioritizing xG data over raw goals.
    *   AS = Team's Average xG For / League Average xG.
    *   DS = Team's Average xG Against / League Average xG.
    *   Apply weighting to the strengths: 65% Season data, 35% Last 6 matches data.
2.  **Calculate Goal Expectancy (GE):**
    *   HOME GE = {HOME} AS * {AWAY} DS * League Avg_H.
    *   AWAY GE = {AWAY} AS * {HOME} DS * League Avg_A.
3.  **Qualitative Adjustments:**
    *   Apply evidence-based adjustments (max +/- 10%) to the GE based on critical contextual factors (e.g., absence of a key striker reduces GE). Document the rationale clearly.
4.  **Probability Calculation (Poisson Distribution):**
    *   Using the final adjusted GE as the lambda (λ) for a Poisson distribution, calculate the probability matrix of every realistic scoreline (e.g., 0-0 up to 6-6).
    *   **INTERNAL PROBABILITY:** Sum the probabilities of all scorelines that satisfy the {MARKET} criteria. (e.g., for "Home Win AND BTTS", sum P(2-1), P(3-1), P(3-2), etc.).

PHASE 3: EXTERNAL PREDICTION BENCHMARKING
1.  **Data Extraction:** Extract the predicted probabilities from the sources listed in Phase 1. bullet 6.
2.  **Market Probability Estimation:** If the exact {MARKET} probability is not provided, estimate it. Acknowledge that this estimation assumes independence between the events.
3.  **Synthesis:** Calculate the average probability for the {MARKET} across all external sources (EXTERNAL CONSENSUS).

PHASE 4: FINAL PROBABILITY SYNTHESIS
Combine the Internal Model probability and the External Benchmark.

1.  **Weighted Average:** Calculate the FINAL PROBABILITY using a weighted approach:
    *   Internal Model (Phase 2): 50% Weight
    *   External Consensus (Phase 3): 50% Weight

PHASE 5: VALUATION
Calculate Fair Odds and Expected Value (EV).

1.  **Fair Odds:** 1 / FINAL PROBABILITY. (Zero Margin).
2.  **Expected Value (EV)%:** ((FINAL PROBABILITY * {GIVEN_ODD}) - 1) * 100.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return exactly the following markdown table and the analysis notes.

**Bet Valuation Summary**

| League   | Home Team | Away Team | Market   | Final Probability | Fair Odds | Given Odd   |    EV    | Value Detected? |

| {LEAGUE} |  {HOME}   |  {AWAY}   | {MARKET} |       [Value]%    |  [Value]  | {GIVEN_ODD} | [Value]% |    [Yes/No]     |
