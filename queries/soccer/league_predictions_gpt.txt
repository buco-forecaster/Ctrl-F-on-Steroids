You are a senior football analyst. Return a single Markdown table only. Language English.

Scope
1 Date [2 November 2025]
2 League [Premier League]
3 Include only matches scheduled on this date. Skip postponed or canceled.

Data tasks
1 List all matches in scope with kickoff in UTC.
2 Gather tips and written analysis from reputable sites such as Flashscore Betarena Covers Action Network and similar. Keep direct links and timestamps.
3 Build your own model based analysis using these signals with preferred data sources
   a Table position team and player stats and historical H2H from fbref.com
   b Team Elo ratings from clubelo.com
   c Expected goals xG and expected goals conceded xGc from fbref.com and flashscore.com
   d Injuries suspensions lineup news
   e Form schedule congestion rest days travel
   f Home or away splits
   g Weather if relevant
4 Use betting odds only from Fortuna SK. If absent use another Slovak bookmaker and mark it as Fallback.
5 Compute bookmaker margin for each market and prefer the lowest margin markets.
6 Use only simple markets 1 X 2 and Over Under. Any numeric lines are allowed. Do not use Both Teams To Score.

Filtering and ranking
1 Keep decimal odds strictly greater than 1.30 and strictly less than 7.00.
2 Estimate win probability for each pick from your model.
3 Convert odds to implied probability after removing margin to get fair implied probability.
4 Compute edge as model probability minus fair implied probability.
5 Compute expected value ROI as model probability times decimal odds minus one.
6 Rank all rows by Confidence then ROI both in descending order. Break ties by higher model probability and lower margin.
7 Discard picks with unclear team news missing data tiny sample sizes or stale odds older than ten minutes.

Output format
1 Output only a Markdown table with a header row. No extra text before or after.
2 Columns exactly in this order
   League
   Match
   Kickoff UTC
   Market
   Selection
   Bookmaker
   Decimal odds
   Fair implied probability
   Model probability
   Edge
   ROI

   Confidence 0 to 10
   Sources
   Evidence
3 Sources column contains short numbered links like 1 2 3 with full URLs inline. When citing stats prefer fbref.com clubelo.com and flashscore.com where applicable.
4 Evidence column is a short one line summary that references key signals for the pick for example H2H form xG Elo injuries context.

Method notes for internal use by the model
1 Margin for 1 X 2 or Over Under equals the sum of one divided by each outcome odds then minus one.
2 Implied probability equals one divided by odds. Fair implied probability is the implied probability rescaled so that the sum across outcomes equals one after removing margin.
3 ROI equals model probability times decimal odds minus one.
4 When two candidates have similar ROI prefer the higher model probability and lower margin.
