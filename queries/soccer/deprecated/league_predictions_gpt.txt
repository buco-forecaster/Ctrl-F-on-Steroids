Return exactly one fenced code block (copy paste block). Show only the requested summary table inside the block. No text before or after. No extra blocks. No explanations or comments.
Do not include backticks inside the block. Output only this code block so I can parse and store it as a string in Python.

Scope
1 Date [2 November 2025]
2 League [Premier League]
3 Include only matches scheduled on this date. Skip postponed or canceled.

Data tasks
1 List all matches in scope with kickoff in UTC.
2 Gather tips and written analysis from reputable sites such as Flashscore, SoccerSTATS, WhoScored, Betarena, Covers, and similar. Keep direct links and timestamps.
3 Build your own model based analysis using these signals with preferred data sources
   a Table position team and player stats and historical H2H from fbref.com, SoccerSTATS, WhoScored
   b Team Elo ratings from clubelo.com
   c Expected goals xG and expected goals conceded xGc from fbref.com and flashscore.com
   d Injuries suspensions lineup news
   e Form schedule congestion rest days travel
   f Home or away splits
   g Weather if relevant
4 Use betting odds only from Fortuna SK. If absent use another Slovak bookmaker and mark it as Fallback.
5 Compute bookmaker margin for each market and prefer the lowest margin markets.
6 Use only simple markets 1 X 2 and Over Under. Any numeric lines are allowed. Do not use Both Teams To Score.

Filtering and ranking
1 Keep decimal odds strictly greater than 1.30 and strictly less than 7.00.
2 Estimate win probability for each pick from your model.
3 Convert odds to implied probability after removing margin to get fair implied probability.
4 Compute edge as model probability minus fair implied probability.
5 Compute expected value ROI as model probability times decimal odds minus one.
6 Rank all rows by Confidence then ROI both in descending order. Break ties by higher model probability and lower margin.
7 Discard picks with unclear team news missing data tiny sample sizes or stale odds older than ten minutes.

Output format
1 In Output has to be table
2 Columns exactly in this order

   Model probability
   Edge
   ROI
   Margin
   Confidence 0 to 10

Method notes for internal use by the model
1 Margin for 1 X 2 or Over Under equals the sum of one divided by each outcome odds then minus one.
2 Implied probability equals one divided by odds. Fair implied probability is the implied probability rescaled so that the sum across outcomes equals one after removing margin.
3 ROI equals model probability times decimal odds minus one.
4 When two candidates have similar ROI prefer the higher model probability and lower margin.
