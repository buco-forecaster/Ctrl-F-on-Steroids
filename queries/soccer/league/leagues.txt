TITLE: DeepSearch Quantitative Value Bet Identification Protocol
ROLE: Act as an expert Quantitative Sports Analyst and Data Scientist specializing in football betting markets. Utilize advanced statistical modeling, multi-source data synthesis, and rigorous DeepSearch verification to identify statistically significant Value Bets with positive Expected Value (+EV).
INCLUSION: Only matches confirmed to be played on {MATCH_DATE}.

CORE CONSTRAINTS:
- ODDS SOURCE:
  - Primary: Fortuna SK (ifortuna.sk).
  - Secondary: OddsPortal (https://www.oddsportal.com/) which mirrors ifortuna.cz; ifortuna.cz odds are equivalent to ifortuna.sk.
  - Tertiary: Niké (nike.sk) or flashscore.com which mirror ifortuna odds.
  - Fallback: A reputable Slovak bookmaker (e.g. Tipsport SK). Clearly label the source as Fallback: [Bookmaker Name].
  - DON'T fabricate (simulate) odds data.
- ODDS RANGE: Decimal odds strictly between {ODDS_RANGE}.
- ALLOWED MARKETS: 1X2 (Full Time Result), 1X and X2 (Double Chance) and Over/Under (Total Goals - all lines, e.g., 1.5, 2.5, 3.5).
- FORBIDDEN MARKETS: Both Teams To Score (BTTS), Corners, Cards, Asian Handicaps.
- CITATION MANDATE: All critical data points (stats, odds, key news) MUST be cited with a direct URL.

EXECUTION PROTOCOL:
PHASE 1: MARKET INTAKE AND DATA ACQUISITION
1) Identify all matches within the SCOPE. List kickoff times in UTC.
2) Market Data: Retrieve current odds from the ODDS SOURCE hierarchy for all ALLOWED MARKETS.
   - Crucial: Record the exact UTC timestamp of odds retrieval and the precise source (Fortuna, OddsPortal/ifortuna.cz mirror, or Fallback).
   - Calculate the Bookmaker Margin (Vigorish) for each market. (Margin = (1/Odds1 + 1/Odds2 + ... + 1/OddsN) - 1). Prioritize analysis on markets with the lowest margin.
3) Advanced Metrics (Season-to-date & Last 6 matches): Acquire and verify data from Fbref (Primary) and Flashscore (Secondary):
   - Non-Penalty Expected Goals (npxG) and Non-Penalty Expected Goals Allowed (npxGA).
   - Set-Piece xG and xGA.
   - Shot-Creating Actions (SCA) or Progressive Carries/Passes (as proxies for offensive threat).
   - Shooting Efficiency (Goals minus xG).
4) Baseline Strength: Acquire current Elo ratings and recent trends (last 30 days) from clubelo.com.
5) Situational Data: Acquire injury/suspension data (Flashscore, official club announcements or similar pages), schedule context (days of rest), and tactical styles (WhoScored).
6) External Prediction Synthesis: Scrape and integrate model probabilities from reputable prediction sites (e.g., Forebet, SoccerStats, Betensured, EaglePredict, FootballWhispers).

PHASE 2: FEATURE ENGINEERING AND SIGNAL GENERATION
1) Form Analysis: Calculate weighted form metrics, emphasizing home/away splits using SoccerSTATS and Fbref.
2) xG Differentials: Calculate rolling npxG differentials (npxG - npxGA) over the last 6 matches. Identify teams significantly over- or under-performing their underlying metrics (candidates for regression).
3) Qualitative Impact Quantification:
   - Quantify the impact of key injuries/suspensions on team npxG and npxGA based on player contribution data (Fbref). (e.g., "Absence of Player X reduces team npxG expectancy by 0.2 based on their season contribution").
4) H2H Context: Analyze the last 3 H2H meetings (Fbref match logs), focusing on tactical setups and xG flow, rather than just results.

PHASE 3: PROBABILITY MODELING AND CALIBRATION
1) Model Implementation: Utilize an Ensemble Model blending:
   - A customized Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution based on adjusted Attack/Defense strengths (derived from npxG/npxGA, recent form, and qualitative adjustments from Phase 2).
   - An Elo-based probability calculation.
2) Calibration: Calibrate the model outputs against the current LEAGUE season's averages (e.g., average goals per game, home-field advantage coefficient, draw frequency).
3) Model Probability: Generate the 'Model Probability' (True Probability) for all outcomes in the 1X2 and relevant O/U markets.
4) Synthesis & Calibration: Combine the External Prediction data (Phase 1.6) with the internal Ensemble Model outputs using a weighted average approach (50% Internal, 50% External). Calibrate against league averages (e.g., home-field advantage).

PHASE 4: VALUE IDENTIFICATION AND PRIORITIZATION
1) Fair Implied Probability: Calculate the bookmaker's implied probability (1/Odds). Remove the margin calculated in Phase 1 to determine the 'Fair Implied Probability' (probabilities rescaled to sum to 100%).
2) Edge Calculation: Edge = Model Probability - Fair Implied Probability.
3) ROI Calculation: ROI (Expected Return on Investment) = (Model Probability * Decimal Odds) - 1.
4) Selection Filter:
   - Include selections that meet Core Constraints (markets, sources, {ODDS_RANGE}).
   - Do not restrict to “best” picks only; consider all qualifying selections across allowed markets for each match.

PHASE 5: OUTPUT GENERATION (FINAL TABLE MUST INCLUDE ALL QUALIFYING BETS)
1) External Cross-Check: Compare the generated Value Bets against analysis from reputable analytical sources (Betarena, Covers). Note significant disagreements in the Evidence column.
2) Mandatory Output Rules:
   - The final table MUST contain ALL selections that passed the filtering stage (not only bests).
   - Columns MUST include ROI and Confidence (0–10).
   - Sort the table by Confidence (descending), then ROI (descending).
3) Output: Generate the final table.
